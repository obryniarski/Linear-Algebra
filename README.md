# Linear Algebra, Plotting, and Data Practice

I'm using this repository to hold practice I do to
help cement my understanding of linear algebra
as I take Math 54.

I may add random small machine learning/data projects.

Also, requirements.txt may contain unnecessary packages. 
Some are added by my IDE, some I haven't gotten around to
practicing with yet.
